# Stag
A repository for the code and resource files for a Matlab app that was developed for Senior Project. As of now, the app can only be run by other Matlab users, as I do not have access to Matlab Compiler Toolbox. However, I will provide the source code for the app and provide screenshots.

# Disclaimer
If you do not have at least a student license of Matlab, you cannot run this app. If you want to see what it is like, the best I can do is to tell you to look at the screenshots. However, if you DO have Matlab, do not be surprised if you have to add the .mlapp file to your MATLAB root path to get it to run properly. Also, if you choose to download these files and try to run it yourself, you are accepting the risk of downloading and running a bunch of files you found on the Internet and you accept full personal responsibility for any consequences that may or may not happen for reasons or causes beyond the original author's control.

# Installation tips
You must download ALL of the files in order for everything to work, especially the letter templates. Once you do that, open Matlab, change your working directory to the folder that contains these files, and double-click on the .mlappinstall file. That will theoretically take you to the App Designer. You will need to package up the app in order to run it in non-debug mode.
